# Making the Next Qatar Foundation Website

We are creating the new Qatar Foundation website in a different way than how we've made big changes before. Previously, we'd have spent quite a long time designing and then building everything. We'd then launch the it to the world. 

We think a better way is to build the new website in chunks. By identifying areas that need the most improvement, we will redesign and launch these individually. Get feedback from our loyal audiences and continuously make it better, faster. 

By using next.qf.org.qa you can see the early stages of the new site as we experiment with features, design and layout.
